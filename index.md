## Hello World!

This is a documentation of the start my web developer journey. After studying Psychology for my undergraduate and Masters' degree, I decided to forgo all those years of hard work and throw myself in the uncharted territory of web development!

I have done roughly a year and a half of self study, trying to learn languages such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS and dabbled in Ruby, SQL, and Python.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Ariane-A/ariane-a.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
