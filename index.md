## Hello World!

This is a documentation of the start my web developer journey. After studying **Psychology** for my undergraduate and Masters' degree, I decided to forgo all those years of hard work and throw myself in the uncharted territory of web development ðŸ˜€

I have done roughly a year and a half of self study, trying to learn languages such as _JavaScript, HTML, CSS_ and dabbled in _Ruby, SQL, and Python_. I am also now doing a level 3 software technician apprenticeship in the hopes of becoming a web developer. The lucky employers of **Design Portfolio** have the honour of teaching me how to work with websites and software! ~~I already signed a contract with them so it's too late for them to back out when they see my computer skills!~~

### Projects

Here are my projects!

**(Coming Soon!)**
