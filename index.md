## Hello World!

This is a documentation of the start my web developer journey. After studying **Psychology** for my undergraduate and Masters' degree, I decided to forgo all those years of hard work and throw myself in the uncharted territory of web development!

I have done roughly a year and a half of self study, trying to learn languages such as _JavaScript, HTML, CSS_ and dabbled in _Ruby, SQL, and Python_.

### Projects

Here are my projects!

**(Coming Soon!)**
